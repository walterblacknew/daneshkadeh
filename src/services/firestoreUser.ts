 * Fetches a user's details from Firestore by their ID.
 * This is a simplified version. In a real app, user data might be in a 'users' collection.
 * For this mock app, we'll assume user data might not be in a separate collection
 * beyond what Auth provides. If a 'users' collection existed, we'd query that.
 *
 * This function is a placeholder for fetching richer user profiles if they were stored.
 * For now, it will return a structure compatible with PeerUser, prioritizing AuthContext data if available locally.
 * If a full 'users' collection exists, this should query it.
 *
 * @param userId The ID of the user to fetch.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to the User object or null if not found.
